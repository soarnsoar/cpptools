# cpptools
My own tools..

Actually I'm not an expert on c++.

But it would be useful to pre-defined the common tools which are used in analysis.
Just load the class/function and use it when I need it.


For example, I usually need a function convering TString to float/double.(When I read a txt file in CERN ROOT)
